This directory is where I would put the class files for Employee, Manager, Engineer, and Intern. But if I were to do this, the tests will fail because the paths to the class files are different when they're imported. I don't want to modify the test files in any way, so I will leave the class files where they are for now. Later, I will possibly make the appropriate, logical changes.
